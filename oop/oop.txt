what is diff between c & c++
c - procedure oriented programing (only function) 
    the program is divided into functions and global data is used for data flow.
c++ - object oriented programing   (one object has -> data & function)
    Object-oriented programming is about organizing data and functions together for easier access and protection


class & object = fruit {orange,pinaple}
    class is user define data-types
    Variables of class are called objects

access modifier = private , protected , public

constructor = class name nu function without any return type use for makeing objects
    when an object is created
destructor = when an object is deleted

encapsulation = private mathi levu getter and setter methods
    Encapsulation in object-oriented programming ensures that data can only be accessed from the functions of the class in which it is defined

abstraction = the process of hiding the internal details of an application from the outer world. decribe in simple terms

inheritance = When a class derives from another class.

polymorphisum = describes situations in which something occurs in several different forms (same function in different class)
                compile time = over loding / run time = over riding

virtual function & abstract class

friend function

method over riding = when the method signature is the same in different class with same parameters.
method over loding = when two or more methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters.
